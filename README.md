# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# CARD COMPONENT

**Create Card.jsx file**
* Create Card function
* Write return statement
* Write export statement

**Inside Card.jsx create a div with className (Note that 'class' is a reserved keyword, we can't use it)**
* Image
* Header
* Paragraph

**Import card component to App.jsx**
* Type import, name of component, from, location of folder
* Write a return statement
* Write export statement

**Find an image for profile picture and save it inside src > assets folder**
* Import image into Card.jsx file
* Import profilePic from asset folder
* Include profile pic inside img element using curly braces

**Edit the size of image inside index.css**
* delete everything - the content in this file is what React set up for us by default.
* Style accordingly

**END RESULT:**
